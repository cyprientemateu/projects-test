        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <p>I am a DevSecOps Engineer with experience in AWS, Kubernetes, CI/CD, and security automation.</p>
	<P>I am a DevOps/Cloud Engineer with over 7 years of experience specializing in optimizing CI/CD pipelines to reduce deployment time and improve software delivery. 
At EK Tech, we develop solutions tailored to client needs, and I have contributed to projects of various scales, including large, medium, and small. I’ve designed infrastructure as code using Terraform to create scalable AWS environments and developed automated CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins and GitHub. These pipelines, integrated with Ansible for configuration management, have reduced manual errors by 25% and improved release efficiency.
My technical expertise includes tools such as:
       Git for version control,
       Docker for containerization,
       Kubernetes for orchestration,
       SonarQube for continuous scanning,
       Slack and Jira for communication and ticketing,
       Confluence for documentation.
Previously, as a Linux System Administrator, I managed various Linux-based distributions, including Ubuntu, CentOS, and Debian, ensuring system stability and security. My responsibilities included server configuration, management, deployment, and troubleshooting.
I have a strong foundation in Agile and DevOps practices, which I’ve successfully implemented to enhance team workflows and achieve project goals.
Additionally, I hold certifications as a Certified Kubernetes Administrator and AWS Certified Solutions Architect. My goal is to leverage my expertise in cloud infrastructure, automation, and continuous improvement to drive success for your team.</p>
