# Instructions to follow: Create a cluster and create EC2 with Terraform and Set up Jenkins and SonarQube for CI/CD
**In this project, you will:**

Provision an EC2 instance using Terraform.
Set up Jenkins and SonarQube on the EC2 instances.
setup a kubernetes cluster.
Create a CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins to integrate Argo CD, SonarQube, and Slack notifications.

## Project Overview

Terraform: Will provision an EC2 instances to host Jenkins and SonarQube.

Jenkins: Will be used as a CI server to build, test, and deploy your Spring Boot application. (use jenkins agent)

SonarQube: Will be used for continuous inspection of code quality.

Argo CD: Will handle the continuous deployment of your application into a Kubernetes cluster.

Slack: Will provide notifications on pipeline success/failure.

# Steps to Achieve This Project:

# 1. Prerequisites

## Ensure you have the following ready before starting:

- AWS Account: You will need an active AWS account with credentials.
- Terraform: Installed on your local machine.
- SSH Keypair: To access the EC2 instance.
- Docker: Installed on the EC2 instance to build and run containers.

# 2. Step-by-Step Instructions for Terraform

## What You Need:

- Terraform installed on your local machine.
- AWS credentials configured (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY).

## Steps:

### Install Terraform:

Ensure Terraform is installed on your local machine by running ```terraform --version``` to check.
If not installed, follow Terraform’s installation instructions from this link: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install.

### Initialize Your Terraform Project:

- Create a new directory for your Terraform project (e.g., terraform-jenkins).
- Inside that directory, create a configuration file (main.tf).
- Configure the AWS provider and define the EC2 instance.

### Configure AWS and EC2 Setup:

- Specify the AWS region and instance type (e.g., t2.medium) for hosting Jenkins and SonarQube.
- Use an Ubuntu AMI that supports Jenkins and SonarQube.
- Make sure to configure security groups to allow traffic on:
- Port 22 (SSH access),
- Port 8080 (Jenkins),
- Port 9000 (SonarQube).

#### Run Terraform Commands:

- Initialize: Run terraform init to initialize the project.
- Plan: Run terraform plan to see what changes will be made.
- Apply: Run terraform apply to provision the EC2 instance.

#### SSH into EC2: Once the instance is running, use the SSH keypair to connect:

```bash
ssh -i <your-keypair>.pem ubuntu@<ec2-public-ip>
```
# 3. Step-by-Step Setup of Jenkins and SonarQube on EC2

## What You Need:

- Jenkins: For building the CI pipeline.
- SonarQube: For code quality analysis.

## Steps:

### Install Jenkins:

##### After SSH into the EC2 instance, install Jenkins:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y openjdk-17-jdk
sudo apt install -y jenkins
sudo systemctl start jenkins
#Access Jenkins at 
http://<ec2-public-ip>:8080.
```
### Install SonarQube:

- Install SonarQube on the same EC2 instance or another server (based on your performance needs):
- Follow SonarQube installation instructions to install it on Ubuntu. https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-server/10.8/setup-and-upgrade/install-the-server/introduction/
```bash
#Access SonarQube at
http://<ec2-public-ip>:9000.
```
# Configure Jenkins:

Install the Maven, SonarQube Scanner, Docker, and Slack Notification plugins.
Connect Jenkins to SonarQube by adding SonarQube in Jenkins under Manage Jenkins > Configure System > SonarQube Servers.
# 4. CI/CD Pipeline Setup with Jenkins, SonarQube, and Argo CD

## What You Need:

- Jenkins: Configured and connected to your GitHub/Bitbucket repository.
- SonarQube: Configured for code analysis.
- Argo CD: Deployed in a Kubernetes cluster.
- Slack: Webhook URL to send notifications.

## Steps:

### Configure Git Integration:

Ensure that Jenkins can pull your Spring Boot project from GitHub.

### Set up Jenkins Pipeline:

In Jenkins, create a Pipeline Job and configure it with a Jenkinsfile that:
+ Pulls code from Git.
+ Runs Maven to build the code and package it.
+ Performs SonarQube analysis to check for code quality.
+ Builds and pushes the Docker image to your container registry.
+ Deploys the application to you Kubernetes cluster using Argo CD.

### Add SonarQube Quality Gate:

If desired, set up a SonarQube Quality Gate that will fail the build if code quality doesn’t meet the required standards.

### Configure Argo CD:

Ensure Argo CD is properly deployed in your Kubernetes cluster and is syncing your Spring Boot application from your Git repository.
Use Jenkins to trigger an Argo CD sync after building and pushing the Docker image to docker hub.

### Set up Slack Notifications:

- In Jenkins, configure the Slack Notification Plugin.
- Add your Slack webhook URL to send notifications to a Slack channel on build success or failure.

# 5. setup Kubernetes cluster

## What You Need:

### Create Amazon EKS cluster using eksctl | How to create Amazon EKS cluster using EKSCTL | Create EKS Cluster in command line
What is Amazon EKS?

Amazon EKS is a fully managed container orchestration service. EKS allows you to quickly deploy a production ready Kubernetes cluster in AWS, deploy and manage containerized applications more easily with a fully managed Kubernetes service. 

EKS takes care of Master node/control plane. We need to manage worker nodes.

### Pre-requisites:

You can use Windows, Macbook or any Ubuntu or Red Hat EC2 instance to setup the below tools.

## Install AWS CLI – Command line tools for working with AWS services, including Amazon EKS.
```bash
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip" 
sudo apt install unzip
sudo unzip awscliv2.zip  
sudo ./aws/install
aws --version
```
## Install eksctl – A command line tool for working with EKS clusters that automates many individual tasks.

```bash
curl --silent --location "https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/releases/latest/download/eksctl_$(uname -s)_amd64.tar.gz" | tar xz -C /tmp
# Move the extracted binary to /usr/local/bin. 
sudo mv /tmp/eksctl /usr/local/bin
eksctl version
```      
## install kubectl – A command line tool for working with Kubernetes clusters. 
```bash
#Update package manager
sudo apt-get update
#install
sudo apt-get install -y kubectl
#Verify if kubectl got installed
kubectl version --client
```
# Create AWS Access Keys

Once you install all of the above, you need to have AWS credentials configured in your environment. The aws configure command is the fastest way to set up your AWS CLI installation for general use. 
Make sure you do not have any IAM role attached to the EC2 instance. You can remove IAM role by going into AWS console and Detach the IAM role.

```bash
aws configure
``` 

the AWS CLI prompts you for four pieces of information: access key, secret access key, AWS Region, and output format.

# Create EKS Cluster using eksctl

```bash
eksctl create cluster --name demo-eks --region us-east-2 --nodegroup-name my-nodes --node-type t3.small --managed --nodes 2 
```
the above command should create a EKS cluster in AWS, it might take 15 to 20 mins. The eksctl tool uses CloudFormation under the hood, creating one stack for the EKS master control plane and another stack for the worker nodes. 

### This should confirm that EKS cluster is up and running.
```bash
eksctl get cluster --name demo-eks --region us-east-2 
```
# Connect to EKS cluster

```bash
aws eks update-kubeconfig --name demo-eks
kubectl get nodes
kubectl get ns
```

# Install prometheus and Grafana to monitor your cluster using helm.

    https://github.com/Angecalais97/prometheus-Grafana-Zero-to-Hero.git

# 6. Review and Clean-up
## delete the cluster 

```bash
eksctl delete cluster --name demo-eks --region us-east-2 
```
